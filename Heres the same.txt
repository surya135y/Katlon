Hereâ€™s the same test case rewritten in BDD Gherkin language format:

Feature: Display of the new BHTP logo across the purchase path

  As BHTP Marketing,
  I want the new BHTP logo to display consistently across all purchase pages,
  So that branding is uniform throughout the site.

  Background:
    Given the user is on the purchase path

  Scenario Outline: BHTP logo is displayed on all purchase path pages
    When the user navigates to the "<Page>"
    Then the new BHTP logo should be displayed in place of the old logo

    Examples:
      | Page                        |
      | Product Comparison Table   |
      | Flights                    |
      | Upgrades                   |
      | Travelers                  |
      | Review                     |
      | Payment                    |
      | Receipt Page              |

  Scenario: BHTP logo links to homepage
    When the user clicks the BHTP logo
    Then the user should be redirected to the homepage

  Scenario: BHTP logo is responsive
    When the user resizes the browser or views the site on a mobile device
    Then the BHTP logo should remain visible and adjust its size accordingly

Let me know if you'd like this exported to a .feature file or integrated into a test automation tool like Cucumber, Katalon, or Behave.
